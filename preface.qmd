# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Who this book is for

Anyone interested in **geospatial data science** will benefit from
reading this book. If you are a student with basic-to-intermediate
programming experience, you will learn a valuable set of tools
for your career. If you are an experienced data scientist, you
can still be surprised by the generality of the framework
presented here.

This is **not** a book on geostatistics. Although some chapters
and examples will cover basic concepts from geostatistical theory,
that is only to illustrate what is possible after you master
geospatial data science with the
[![](images/julia.svg){fig-alt="Julia" width=40px}](https://julialang.org)
programming language.

## Why Julia?

An effective implementation of the framework presented in this book
requires a language that can:

- Generate high-performance code
- Specialize on multiple arguments
- Evaluate code interactively
- Exploit parallel hardware

This list of requirements eliminates Python, R and other
mainstream languages used for data science.

## How to read this book

If this is your first encounter with
[![](images/julia.svg){fig-alt="Julia" width=40px}](https://julialang.org)
or with programming in general, consider reading the open source book
[*Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)
by @LauwensDowney2018. It introduces the language to
first-time programmers and explains basic concepts that you will
need to know to master the material here.

If you are an experienced programmer who just wants to quickly
learn the syntax of the language, consider checking the
[Learn Julia in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia)
website. If you are seeking more detailed information, consider
reading the [official documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1).

Assuming that you learned the basics of the language, you can proceed
and read this book. It is organized in three parts as follows:

  preread["Julia basics âœ…"] --> partI
  subgraph partI["Part I. Foundations"]
    chapter1["1. What is geospatial data?"]
    chapter2["2. Scientific visualization"]
    chapter3["3. Interfacing with GIS"]
    chapter1 --> chapter2
    chapter2 --> chapter3
  end
  subgraph partII["Part II. Transforms"]
    chapter4["4. Transforming features"]
    chapter5["5. Transforming geometries"]
    chapter6["6. Geospatial transforms"]
    chapter4 --> chapter5
    chapter5 --> chapter6
  end
  subgraph partIII["Part III. Queries"]
    chapter7["7. Split-apply-combine"]
    chapter8["8. Geospatial joins"]
    chapter7 --> chapter8
  end
  partI --> partII
  partI --> partIII
```

The chapters were written to be read in sequence, but there is
some flexibility on how to read the parts. I recommend reading
**Part I** first to understand the framework and vision. After
that, you will have the necessary background to follow the code
examples in **Part II** and **Part III**.
