# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Who this book is for

Anyone interested in **geospatial data science** and
**geostatistical modeling** will benefit from reading
this book. If you don't know what geospatial data science
is, that is already a good reason for reading it. If you
have been exposed to the concept, you can still be surprised
by the generality of the framework presented here.

This is **not** a book on geostatistics. Some chapters will
cover basic concepts from geostatistical theory, but that is
not the ultimate goal. This book will teach you a set of tools
that you can use to answer practical questions with geospatial
data, which would be very hard to answer with other existing
approaches and programming languages.
