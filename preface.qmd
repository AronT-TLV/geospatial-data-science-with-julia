# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Who this book is for

Anyone interested in **geospatial data science** will benefit from
reading this book. If you are a student with basic-to-intermediate
programming experience, you will learn a valuable set of tools
for your career. If you are an experienced data scientist, you
can still be surprised by the generality of the framework
presented here.

This is **not** a book on geostatistics. Although some chapters
and examples will cover basic concepts from geostatistical theory,
that is only to illustrate what is possible after you master
geospatial data science with the

programming language.

## How to read this book

If this is your first encounter with the programming language,
consider reading the open source book
[*Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)
by Lauwens, B. & Downey, A. 2018.

## Why Julia?

An effective implementation of the framework presented in this book
requires a language that can:

- Generate high-performance code
- Specialize on multiple arguments
- Evaluate code interactively
- Exploit parallel hardware

This list of requirements eliminates Python, R and other
mainstream languages used for data science.
