# Split-apply-combine

In **Part II** of the book, we introduced **transform pipelines** to
process the `values` and the `domain` of geotables using high-level
abstractions that preserve geospatial information. In this chapter, we
start to introduce other tools to **query** geotables after they have been
pre-processed by pipelines.

## Motivation

In geospatial data science, geoscientific questions are often posed in
terms of both the `values` and the `domain` of a geotable. For example:

1. **Where** are the areas with maximum probability of landslide?
2. What is the average rainfall **per watershed** over the last year?
3. How much Lithium will be mined from each **geological unit**?

The word "where" is often present in these questions to indicate that
the answer must be georeferenced as a new geotable. If the word is not
present, then there will be some reference to geospatial units where
geostatistics must be computed.

The **split-apply-combine** strategy [@Wickham2011] from data
science can be adapted to address such questions. Our framework
provides three macros `@groupby`, `@transform` and `@combine`
to split-apply-combine geotables in a way that preserves
geospatial information.
