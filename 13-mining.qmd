In the mining industry, **resource estimation** consists of interpolating
measurements of metal and mineral grades from drill hole samples to a 3D block
model. Due to highly skewed distributions, several pre-processing steps need to
be done before the actual interpolation. In this chapter, we will cover different
approaches to resource estimation and [geometallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometallurgy).

**TOOLS COVERED:** `geojoin`, `@groupby`, `@transform`, `@combine`,
`ProjectionPursuit`, `EmpiricalVariogram`, `Kriging`, `InterpolateNeighbors`

**MODULES:**

```{julia}
# load framework
using GeoStats

# IO packages
using CSV

# plotting packages
using PairPlots
import CairoMakie as Mke
```

## Data

We will use the [GeoMet](https://zenodo.org/record/7051975) dataset by @Hoffimann2022_1,
which consists of three geospatial tables stored as CSV files: **drillholes.csv**,
**comminution.csv** and **flotation.csv**.

### Drillholes

The drill hole samples are always available in mining projects. They contain chemical
information for each (1-meter-long) cylinder along the drill hole trajectories. In this
case, the data has been processed, and only the "X", "Y", "Z" coordinates of the centroids
of the cylinders were stored:

```{julia}
url = "https://zenodo.org/record/7051975/files/drillholes.csv?download=1"

dtable = georef(CSV.File(download(url)), ("X", "Y", "Z"))

dtable |> viewer
```

```{julia}
dtable |> describe
```

There are 18 chemical elements in the table, all measured in parts per million (ppm).
The table also stores the an integer identifier for each hole trajectory in the
"HOLEID" column. There are 119 such tajectories as shown in the `maximum` column
of the `describe` output.

In most mining projects, the drill hole samples are available as "SURVEY",
"COLLAR" and "INTERVAL" tables, which can be desurveyed and composited with
[DrillHoles.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/DrillHoles.jl).

### Comminution

The comminution samples are more expensive to obtain as they require external
laboratorial analysis. In this case, they are available for (10-meter-long) cylinders:

```{julia}
url = "https://zenodo.org/record/7051975/files/comminution.csv?download=1"

ctable = georef(CSV.File(download(url)), ("X", "Y", "Z"))

ctable |> viewer
```

```{julia}
ctable |> describe
```

Besides the chemical elements, the table also contains specific parameters such
as "th1", "th2", "th3", "F80", "P80", "M", "A", which are related to comminution
tests [@Tavares2013]. Very informally, a comminution test measures the geomechanical
"strength" or "fragility" of a sample.

### Flotation

Finally, flotation tests measure properties of the sample that are related to the
separation of economic vs non-economic material through fluid dynamic processes.
In this case, the metallurgical recovery in the locked-cycle-test (LCT) is important:

```{julia}
url = "https://zenodo.org/record/7051975/files/flotation.csv?download=1"

ftable = georef(CSV.File(download(url)), ("X", "Y", "Z"))

ftable |> viewer
```

```{julia}
ftable |> describe
```
