In **Part II** and **Part III** of the book, we learned two important
tools for *efficient* geospatial data science. We learned how transform
pipelines can be used to prepare geospatial data for investigation, and
how geospatial queries can be used to answer geoscientific questions.

Before we can learn the third tool in our geospatial data science framework,
we need to review the important concept of **geospatial correlation**:

## Definition

The **geospatial correlation** between two variables $X$ and $Y$ measured at
a distance (or lag) $h$ along any direction is the sample
[Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient).
Given $n$ pairs $\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$ of
measurements, the coefficient is given by

$$
r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

:::

We can illustrate this concept for different values of the lag $h$ using the
`hscatter` plot.

Let's consider the following synthetic image from the
[GeoStatsImages.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStatsImages.jl)
module:

```{julia}
using GeoStatsImages

img = geostatsimage("Gaussian30x10")

img |> viewer
```

and let's sample this image to reduce the computational costs:

```{julia}
sample = img |> Sample(1000, replace=false)
```

If we plot the values of the variable `Z` in the horizontal axis and the values
of the same variable measured at lag $h=0$ on the vertical axis, we get points
along the identity line:

```{julia}
hscatter(sample, :Z, :Z, lag=0.0)
```

By increasing the value of the lag, we observe that the correlation is no longer
equal to one, and that the linear fit through the points approaches the horizontal
axis (i.e., zero correlation):

```{julia}
hscatter(sample, :Z, :Z, lag=3.0)
```

```{julia}
hscatter(sample, :Z, :Z, lag=5.0)
```

```{julia}
hscatter(sample, :Z, :Z, lag=10.0)
```

```{julia}
hscatter(sample, :Z, :Z, lag=50.0)
```
