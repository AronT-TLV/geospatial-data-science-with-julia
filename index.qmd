# Welcome {.unnumbered}

*Geospatial Data Science with Julia* provides a fresh
approach to data science with geospatial data and the

programming language.
It contains best practices for writting *clean*, *readable*
and *performant* code in geoscientific applications
involving sophisticated representations of the subsurface
of the Earth such as unstructured meshes made of 2D and
3D geometries.

By reading this book, you will:

1. Get a broader perspective on geospatial data
2. Learn advanced geostatistical algorithms
3. Reproduce practical **open-source examples**
