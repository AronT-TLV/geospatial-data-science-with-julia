# Welcome {.unnumbered}

*Geospatial Data Science with Julia* presents a fresh
approach to data science with geospatial data and the
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics/b5551ca7946b4a25746c045c15fbb8806610f8d0/images/julia-logo-color.svg){fig-alt="Julia" width=40px}](https://julialang.org)
programming language.
It contains best practices for writting *clean*, *readable*
and *performant* code in geoscientific applications
involving sophisticated representations of the (sub)surface
of the Earth such as unstructured meshes made of 2D and
3D geometries.

By reading this book, you will:

1. Get a broader perspective on geospatial data
2. Learn advanced geostatistical algorithms
3. Reproduce practical **open source** examples

Most importantly, you will learn a set of geospatial features
much more rich than the
[simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features)
implemented in traditional geographic information systems (GIS).

## How to contribute?

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the book.
It's people like you that make this project so interesting.
Below are a few suggestions to facilitate the review process:

- Please be polite, we are here to help and learn from each other
- Try to explain your contribution with simple language
- References to textbooks and papers are always welcome
- Follow the code style in the examples as much as possible

This book is [open source](https://github.com/juliohm/geospatial-data-science-with-julia)
and fully reproducible thanks to the amazing
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) project. You can edit the pages
directly on GitHub and submit a pull request for review.
If you are not familiar with this process, consider reading
the [first contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) guide.

Alternatively, you can render the book locally with the
[Quarto VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto),
which is the recommended method for reviewing more elaborate changes.

## Getting involved

If you would like to get involved with the project, you can start by:

- Sharing the book on your social media

- [Starring](https://github.com/juliohm/geospatial-data-science-with-julia) the GitHub repository

- [Citing](CITATION.bib) the project in your articles

- Reviewing the text for mispellings

- Asking questions and making suggestions

You can also suggest entirely new code examples from different
geoscientific applications provided that the code and the data
are open and freely accessible.
