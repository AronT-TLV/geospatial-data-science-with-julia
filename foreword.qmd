# Foreword {.unnumbered}

I've always felt that something was wrong with the current approaches
to geospatial data science in other programming languages. I remember
sitting in
[Stanford's Green library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_H._Green_Library) after a short
introductory course on GIS with R, and wondering why I had to be so
"computer sciency":

- What on Earth is a "LineString"? Isn't a line a geometric object with infinite lenght?
- Why do I need to learn this low-level distinction between "raster" and "vector" data?

Something was off for sure, but it took me years after my PhD to envision
a more general approach to geospatial data science through the consistent
development of the
[GeoStats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl) framework.

I have to say, it is not easy to swim against the wave when most people
are still surfing ~20-year-old standards like the
[simple features](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html).
One thing I learned over the years is that geosciences is **not** simple,
is **not** 2D, and is **not** advanced with sotware engineering mentality.
