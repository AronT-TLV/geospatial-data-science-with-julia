# Foreword {.unnumbered}

I've always felt that something was off with existing approaches
to geospatial data science in other programming languages.
I remember sitting in the beautiful
[Stanford's Green library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_H._Green_Library)
after a short introductory course on GIS with R, and wondering
why it had to be so "computer sciency":

- What on Earth is a "LineString"? Isn't a "Line" a geometric object with infinite length?
- Why do I need to learn this low-level distinction between "raster" and "vector" data?

After years of my PhD I finally found a more general approach,
through the continuous development of the
[![](images/geostats.svg){fig-alt="GeoStats.jl" width=110px}](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl)
framework. This book is the first attempt to share this vision with
the broader scientific community.

I have to say that it is not easy to swim against the wave of
[simple features](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html).
Most software developers out there are still surfing this ~20-year-old
standard in spite of pretty major limitations. Geoscience is **not**
simple, is **not** 2D, and should **not** be discussed as if it was
software. Unfortunately, most GIS work nowadays focuses on computer
representation and storage requirements as opposed to better abstraction.
In this book, you learn *how to think with geospatial data*, which is
much more important.

There is a long journey until the technology reaches its full potential,
but it is getting there! I hope that the book will enlighten your
understanding of some of those issues and that you can benefit
from the **open source framework** we built over the years.
