# Foreword {.unnumbered}

I've always felt that something was off with existing approaches
to geospatial data science in other programming languages.
I remember sitting in the beautiful
[Stanford's Green library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_H._Green_Library)
after a short introductory course on GIS with R, and wondering
why it had to be so "computer sciency":

- What on Earth is a "LineString"? Isn't a "Line" a geometric object with infinite length?
- Why do I need to learn this low-level distinction between "raster" and "vector" data?
- And many other questions...

After years of my PhD, I finally envisioned a more general approach,
through the continuous design and development of the
[![](images/geostats.svg){fig-alt="GeoStats.jl" width=110px}](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl)
framework. This book is the first attempt to share this vision with
the broader scientific community.

There is a long journey until the technology reaches its full potential,
but it is getting there! I hope that the book will enlighten your
understanding of some of those issues and that you can benefit
from the **open source** software we built over the years.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that it is not easy to move away from ~20-year-old standards
like [simple features](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html). You will
encounter a great deal of reluctance to change in industry, and that is
human nature. My only advise is to always remind yourself that geoscience
is **not** simple, is **not** 2D, and is **not** software engineering.
