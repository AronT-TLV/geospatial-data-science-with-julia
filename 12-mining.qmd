In the mining industry, resource estimation consists of interpolating
measurements of metal and mineral grades from drill hole samples to 3D
grids known as "block models". Due to highly skewed distributions, several
pre-processing steps need to be performed before the actual interpolation.
In this chapter, we will cover simple steps for resource estimation and
economic assessment of a real mineral deposit.

**TOOLS COVERED:** `geojoin`, `@groupby`, `@transform`, `@combine`,
`ProjectionPursuit`, `EmpiricalVariogram`, `Kriging`, `InterpolateNeighbors`

**MODULES:**

## Data

The [GeoMet](https://zenodo.org/record/7051975) dataset [@Hoffimann2022_1]
consists of three geospatial tables stored as CSV files. In this chapter, we
will use the **drillholes.csv** and the **flotation.csv** tables.

### Drillholes

Drill hole samples are always available in mining projects. They contain chemical
information for each (1-meter-long) cylinder along the drill hole trajectories. In this
case, the data has been processed, and only the "X", "Y", "Z" coordinates of the centroids
of the cylinders were stored:

```{julia}
url = "https://zenodo.org/record/7051975/files/drillholes.csv?download=1"

dtable = georef(CSV.File(download(url)), ("X", "Y", "Z"))

viewer(dtable, pointsize = 4)
```

```{julia}
dtable |> describe
```

There are 18 chemical elements in the table, all measured in parts per million (ppm).
The table also stores an integer identifier for each hole trajectory in the "HOLEID"
column. There are 119 such tajectories as shown in the "maximum" column of the
`describe` output.

::: {.callout-note}

In most mining projects, the drill hole samples are available as "SURVEY",
"COLLAR" and "INTERVAL" tables, which can be desurveyed and composited with
[DrillHoles.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/DrillHoles.jl).

### Flotation

Flotation tests measure properties of the sample that are related to fluid dynamic
processes at the processing plant. For instance, the metallurgical recovery in the
locked-cycle-test (LCT) is the fraction of material that floats to the top of the
equipament after various flotation cycles [@Hoffimann2022_2]. The material that
floats is carried forward in the plant given its economic value (e.g., copper):

```{julia}
url = "https://zenodo.org/record/7051975/files/flotation.csv?download=1"

ftable = georef(CSV.File(download(url)), ("X", "Y", "Z"))

viewer(ftable, pointsize = 4)
```

```{julia}
ftable |> describe
```

In this table, the "LCT" column refers to the **recovery of copper**. The average
recovery of copper is approximately 88% according to the `describe` output.
Another important observation is that there are far less flotation samples
than drill hole samples.

## Objectives

Our main objective is to estimate the economic value associated with each mining block in
a 3D block model, i.e. a `CartesianGrid` with `Hexahedron` geometries (the blocks). This
economic value in U$ dollars is estimated in terms of various other geospatial variables:

$$
Value = \underbrace{V \times \rho \times Cu \times REC \times P}_{\text{revenue}} - \underbrace{V \times \rho \times (C_m + C_p)}_{\text{cost}}
$$

where

- $V$ is the volume of the block in $m^3$
- $\rho$ is the rock density in $ton/m^3$
- $Cu$ is the grade of copper in $[0,1]$
- $REC$ is the recovery of copper in $[0,1]$
- $P$ is the selling price in $U\$/ton$
- $C_m$ is the mining cost in $U\$/ton$
- $C_p$ is the plant cost in $U\$/ton$

Secondary objectives include the localization (through 3D visualization) of
blocks with high economic value, high grades of Au and Ag, and low grade of S.

For simplicity, we assume the following constants:

- $\rho = 2.75\ ton / m^3$
- $P = 4000\ U\$ / ton$
- $C_m = 4\ U\$ / ton$
- $C_u = 10\ U\$ / ton$

## Methodology

In order to estimate the economic value of each mining block, we need to interpolate the grade
of Cu. Because we also want to localize the blocks with high grades of Au and Ag, and low grade
of S, we will perform *multivariate* geostatistical interpolation of Cu, Au, Ag and S.

The proposed methodology has the following steps:

1. Preliminary analysis and processing
2. Definition of interpolation domain
3. Multivariate geostatistical interpolation
4. Economic assessment and visualizations

### Preliminary analysis

We recommend to start any application discarding all information that is not relevant for the
stated objectives. In this case, the two geotables contain measurements of various chemical elements
that are not used in the economic assessment. We define **cleaning pipelines** that select and rename
columns of interest:

```{julia}
selectholeid = Select("HOLEID") â†’
               Coerce("HOLEID" => Multiclass)

selectgrades = Select("Cu ppm" => "Cu",
                      "Au ppm" => "Au",
                      "Ag ppm" => "Ag",
                      "S ppm"  => "S") â†’
                      Functional(x -> 1e-4*x*u"percent") # 1 ppm = 1e-4 percent

dclean = selectholeid âŠ” selectgrades
```

```{julia}
selectrecovery = Select("LCT" => "REC") â†’
                 Functional(x -> 100*x*u"percent") # 1 = 100 percent

fclean = selectholeid âŠ” selectrecovery âŠ” selectgrades
```

The application of these pipelines leads to geotables that are easier to analyse:

```{julia}
dtable = dclean(dtable)
```

```{julia}
ftable = fclean(ftable)
```
