  abstract = "{Brazilian pre-salt reservoirs are mainly carbonate formations and they represent a great opportunity for research development. There is an increasing need of synthetic simulation models that reproduce these Pre-salt flow features for research development in reservoir simulation. This work presents a simulation benchmark model available as public domain data that represents Brazilian pre-salt trends and add a great opportunity to test new methodologies for reservoir development and management using numerical simulation.The work structure is divided in three steps: development of a reference model with known properties, development of a simulation model under uncertainties considering a specific date that represents the field development phase, and, elaboration of a benchmark proposal for studies related to the oil field development and production strategy selection. The reference model, treated as the real field, is a fine grid model in order to guarantee a high level of geologic details. The simulation model under uncertainties is a large scale model, a result of a development project considering an initial stage of field management.The benchmark model is based in a combination of Pre-salt characteristics and Ghawar field information given its diagenetic events and flow features close to Pre-salt. Based on the available information, several uncertainty attributes were considered in structural framework, facies, petrophysical properties, discrete fracture network. Economic and technical uncertainties were also considered. There is an increasing need of synthetic simulation models that reproduce these Pre-salt flow features for research development in reservoir simulation. This work presents a simulation benchmark model available as public domain data that represents Brazilian pre-salt trends and add a great opportunity to test new methodologies for reservoir development and management using numerical simulation. The main result of this project is achieved: the construction of a reference model and the construction of a simulation model under uncertainties assuming the well log information from three wells. This work provides a great contribution for further research development in reservoirs with geologic and dynamic pre-salt trends.}",

  abstract={Statistical learning theory provides the foundation to applied machine learning, and its various successful applications in computer vision, natural language processing and other scientific domains. The theory, however, does not take into account the unique challenges of performing statistical learning in geospatial settings. For instance, it is well known that model errors cannot be assumed to be independent and identically distributed in geospatial (a.k.a. regionalized) variables due to spatial correlation; and trends caused by geophysical processes lead to covariate shifts between the domain where the model was trained and the domain where it will be applied, which in turn harm the use of classical learning methodologies that rely on random samples of the data. In this work, we introduce the geostatistical (transfer) learning problem, and illustrate the challenges of learning from geospatial data by assessing widely-used methods for estimating generalization error of learning models, under covariate shift and spatial correlation. Experiments with synthetic Gaussian process data as well as with real data from geophysical surveys in New Zealand indicate that none of the methods are adequate for model selection in a geospatial context. We provide general guidelines regarding the choice of these methods in practice while new methods are being actively researched.}

  abstract = {Directional variograms were introduced in geostatistics as a tool for revealing major directions of correlation in spatial data. However, their estimation presents some practical challenges, particularly in the case of large irregularly-sampled data sets where efficient spectral-based estimation methods are not applicable. In this work, we propose a generalization of directional variograms to general partitions of spatial data, and introduce a parallel estimation algorithm that can efficiently handle large data sets with more than 105 points. This partition variogram generalization is motivated by a five-spot point pattern in the petroleum industry, which we named more generally as the isolated-lines arrangement. In such an arrangement, traditional estimators of directional variograms such as r-tube estimators very often fail to incorporate measurements from adjacent lines (e.g. vertical wells) without also incorporating measurements from other planes (e.g. horizontal layers). We provide illustrations of this new concept, and assess the approximation error of the proposed estimators with bootstrap methods and synthetic Gaussian process data.}
